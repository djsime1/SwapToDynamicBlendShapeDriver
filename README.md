# SwapToDynamicBlendShapeDriver

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) which adds a button to [SkinnedMeshRenderers](https://wiki.resonite.com/Component:SkinnedMeshRenderer) that moves any driven blendshapes to their own [DynamicBlendShapeDriver](https://wiki.resonite.com/Component:DynamicBlendShapeDriver).

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
2. Place [SwapToDynamicBlendShapeDriver.dll](https://github.com/djsime1/SwapToDynamicBlendShapeDriver/releases/latest/download/SwapToDynamicBlendShapeDriver.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create this folder for you.
3. Start the game and browse to or create a SkinnedMeshRenderer component using the Inspector. Two new buttons should appear at the bottom of the component.
